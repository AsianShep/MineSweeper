# MineSweeper
A minesweeper game made in C++ using the SFML library for graphics. The game is fully playable with using right click to flag a tile and left click to reveal a tile. There are also additional buttons to load preset boards and turn on debug mode to show where the mines are. Clicking the smiley face in the center will reset and rerandomize the board. There is also a counter in the left corner showing how many mines are on left on the board that has not been flagged.
